Thanks for helping make Nova Fox Companion better.

1. Open an issue before a large behavior or protocol change.
2. Keep hook payloads metadata-only. Never add prompt, transcript, source-code, tool-input, or tool-output forwarding.
3. Preserve existing Codex hook configuration during install and uninstall.
4. Run `npm test` before opening a pull request.
5. Keep settings keyboard-accessible, preserve tray and shortcut recovery, and respect reduced-motion settings.
6. Keep personal Pet packages out of Git; tests should use generated fixtures or a local library discovered at runtime.
7. Treat local rollout files as private. Metadata enrichment may extract task path, nickname, model, and effort only; never retain prompt, response, tool, or transcript content.
8. Keep `.codexpet` import allowlists, size limits, staging, and non-overwrite guarantees covered by tests.

Use conventional, focused commits. A pull request should explain the visible behavior, privacy impact, and how it was tested.
